# CollateX_normbydico
## About
*Synopsis*: Collating texts with important variations in spelling (e.g. in Middle French), this small code enables you to normalise your texts for the collation using a dictionary of regulated spellings. 

*Example*: if your dictionary contains concordances for "doibvent", "dobvent" refering to the regulated spelling "doivent", those diffent spellings will not be given as different readings of the text but as the same one, which will be important for instance if you want to establish a stemma.
